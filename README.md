# HTML5 CustomElements
**Printing a hello world with an HTML CustomElement**   
 HTML5 allows developers to create and use their custom elements. To do so, the element must be registered into the **CustomElementRegistry obect** which is done with JavaScript   
 This can be done through **"define"** method of **"customElements"** object which in itself belongs to the CustomElementRegistry object.\
